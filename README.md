# Towards Good Practices for Deep 3D Hand Pose Estimation
By Hengkai Guo (Updated on Aug 9, 2017)

## Description
This is the project of work [Region Ensemble Network: Improving Convolutional Network for Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02447) and [Towards Good Practices for Deep 3D Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07248). This repository includes the prediction results for comparison, prediction codes and visualization codes. More details will be released in the future. Here are live results from Kinect 2 sensor using the model trained on ICVL:

## Results
Here we provide the testing results of basic network (`results/dataset_basic.txt`) and region ensemble network (`results/dataset_ren_nx6x6.txt`) for [ICVL](http://www.iis.ee.ic.ac.uk/~dtang/hand.html) dataset, [NYU](http://cims.nyu.edu/~tompson/NYU_Hand_Pose_Dataset.htm) dataset and [MSRA](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/yichenw/handpose/cvpr15_MSRAHandGestureDB.zip) dataset in our paper. Also we provide the testing labels (`labels/dataset_test_label.txt`), computed centers (`labels/dataset_center.txt`, which can be computed by `evaluation/get_centers.py`) and corresponding image names (`labels/dataset_test_list.txt`). Currently, the MSRA center computation is not available due to lack of loading function for images.

For results and labels, each line is corresponding to one image, which has J x 3 numbers indicating (x, y, z) of J joint locations. The (x, y) are in pixels and z is in mm.

## Evaluation
Please use the Python script `evaluation/compute_error.py` for evaluation, which requires [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). Here is an example:
``` bash
$ python evaluation/compute_error.py icvl results/icvl_ren_9x6x6.txt
```

## Visualization
Please use the Python script `evaluation/show_result.py` for visualziation, which also requires [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/):
``` bash
$ python evaluation/show_result.py icvl your/path/to/ICVL/images/test/Depth --in_file=results/icvl_ren_4x6x6.txt
```
You can see all the testing results on the images. Press 'q' to exit.

## Prediction
Please use the Python script `evaluation/run_model.py` for prediction with predefined centers in `labels` directory:
``` bash
$ python evaluation/run_model.py icvl ren_4x6x6 your/path/to/output/file your/path/to/ICVL/images/test
```
The script depends on [pyCaffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe). Please install the Caffe first.

## Models
The caffe models can be downloaded at [BaiduYun](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1geFecSF) or [here](http://image.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/models/icip2017-ren/models.zip). Please put them in the `models` directory. (For MSRA models, we only provide the one for fold 1 due to the limit of memory.)

## Realsense Realtime Demo
We provide a realtime hand pose estimation demo using Intel Realsense device.

### Using [pyrealsense](https://github.com/toinsson/pyrealsense)
When you are using [pyrealsense](https://github.com/toinsson/pyrealsense) v1.x and v0.x, please use the Python script for demo:
``` bash
$ python demo/realsense_realtime_demo_pyrealsense_1.x.py
```
When you are using [pyrealsense](https://github.com/toinsson/pyrealsense) v2.0 and above, please use the Python script for demo:
``` bash
$ python demo/realsense_realtime_demo_pyrealsense_2.x.py
```

### Using [librealsense](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense)
Firstly compile and install the [python wrapper](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/5285629b4ddb374f1). After everything is working properly, just run the following python script for demo:
``` bash
$ python demo/realsense_realtime_demo_librealsense2.py
```
Note that we just use a naive depth thresholding method to detect the hand. Therefore, the hand should be in the range of [0, 650mm] to run this demo.
We tested this realtime demo with an [Intel Realsense SR300](https://software.intel.com/en-us/realsense/sr300camera).
